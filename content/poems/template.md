# Every time you write a new poem, you'll need to fill in these parameters. Don't worry, it's simple!
title: My Lovely Title # Just a title, super easy. If you use a colon in title, enclose the whole thing in quotes.

date: 2026-01-02 # The date must be in this format: "YYYY-MM-DD". Other formats will result in an error.

draft: false # VERY IMPORTANT: switch this to "false" when you're ready to publish. Until then, this post will only remain in your content folder and not be published to the site.

summary: Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Ut non enim eleifend felis pretium feugiat. Vivamus quis mi. Phasellus a est. Phasellus magna. In hac habitasse platea dictumst. # Delete this dummy text above and write a short, catchy summary. Often an excerpt works really well.

tags: # List some tags here. These help you connect your posts with other related ones. Use as many as you like, but more importantly, the more posts share the same tag, the better.
    - walk
    - travel # ! Be sure to maintain indentation when you add tags!

params: 
    cover: images/entry-1-cover.jpg # This is an important parameter. This is the featured image that every post has! Find a nice one that's free to use. The best sites incluse unsplash.com, pixabay.com, pexels.com and even WikiMedia Commons if you're looking for historical/geographic photos. Don't just use random images off of Google, as some of them may not be free to use. Download the images, upload them to the static/images folder and then link them here like this: /images/the-name-of-your-photo.jpg (or.png, or.webp, or whatever file extension your photo has.) And that's it!
